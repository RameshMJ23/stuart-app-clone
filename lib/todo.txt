// In some screens (ex. transaction_screen), the interface is completely
// empty, show some texts like (no transaction)

// show snackBar when an unavailable station is clicked

// Should we need two screens? One for general view and another for
// showing details of the screen? This can concisely been shown in a
// single screen. We can try this!
// To add to this when filtered, there are not many stations showing on the screen
// So it is good to add move option when tapped else, UX is not going to be good
                |
// When filtered its actually showing all the places instead of showing only
// filtered ones // Its a bug, its reloading but when its closed adn reopened
